            I&apos;m a passionate Full-Stack Developer with expertise in
            building scalable web applications and automation systems. I hold a
            Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree from Kuvempu
            University, where I developed a strong foundation in programming and
            problem-solving.

            My journey into coding began with my brother, who introduced me to
            the world of programming. What started as curiosity soon turned into
            a passion. During college, I began selling projects to fellow
            students, which not only honed my skills but also gave me a taste of
            entrepreneurship. After graduation, I started my career with an
            organization where I worked on impactful projects and continued to
            grow as a developer.

            During my final year of college, I took a bold step and started
            building SqebueBooks, a cloud accounting system. Despite lacking
            knowledge and financial support, I pursued this dream passionately.
            However, I eventually joined a company and had to drop the project,
            feeling like I lost a part of myself. But I&apos;m determined to
            return to this dream soon.

            In my final year of college, I started working on SqebueBooks, a
            cloud-based accounting system. It was my first serious attempt at
            building a full product â€” done without any guidance, funding, or
            experience. Though I eventually paused the project after joining my
            first company, it gave me a strong foundation in backend
            architecture and product thinking early in my journey.
